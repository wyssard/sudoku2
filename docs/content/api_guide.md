# API Guide

This guide walks you through the creation of solving method, stepper and formatting classes. The respective instances can then be composed to a solver object by following the procedure illustrated in the [Custom Solver section](custom_solver.md). Make sure to consider the latter section first before continuing with this guide.

The creation of the **solving method**, **stepper** and **formatting** classes is thereby illustrated by reproducing classes that are already integral part of this package. To avoid duplicate code, there's no example code for the largest part of this guide. We only provide a small snippet to illustrate the usage of the classes you are to create thereinafter.

## Solving Methods

Let us begin by reimplementing the most basic of all solving methods. 

## Steppers

## Formatters

## Assembly
